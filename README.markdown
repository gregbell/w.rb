# W.rb - The super small Wiki

## The Idea
Make the smallest possible wiki around. For what purpose you might ask? Well none really.
Just for fun.

The current implementation includes 15 lines of code for a full wiki, markdown and templates.

## How to Use
Install any dependencies:
	> sudo gem install sinatra rdiscount

As simple as it gets, run w.rb:
	> ruby w.rb

Then open up http://localhost:4567

## Next Steps & Todos
* Add versions through git
